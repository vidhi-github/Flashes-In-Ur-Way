The Flashcard Learning Tool is a simple web application built with React that allows users to create, view, and flip through a set of flashcards. Each flashcard displays a question or term on the front and reveals the answer or definition on the back when flipped. Additionally, the tool provides an internal dashboard for admins to manage the flashcards by adding, editing, or deleting them.

**Features:**

**Flashcard Display:** View one flashcard at a time, showing the question/term on the front.

**Card Flipping:** Click on a flashcard to flip it and reveal the answer on the back.

**Navigation:** Navigate through the flashcards using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

**Flashcard Management:** Add new flashcards, edit existing ones, or delete flashcards using the internal dashboard.
